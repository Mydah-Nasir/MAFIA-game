
Hardly any rules for this 

-You must roleplay the character you were 
assigned.
-Avoid sneaking in on others because that really 
ruins the game.
-You can pretend to be Mafia/Civilian but don't 
complain if they kill you off!
-Don't be a crybaby if they vote you out or you 
get  killed by Mafia.
-Don't be a crybaby if the game decides to kill 
you off randomly.
-Enjoy.
